		This particular website was developed entierly by me for one of the classes that
		I am taking this semester (Spring 2017, in case you were wondering). Contained within
		this site is a little bit more about myself as a person, my professional resume, and
		my contact info. Please enjoy browsing through the pages, and if you have any questions
