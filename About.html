	<h2> Hello World!</h2>
	<p>My name is Tiffini Tobiasson.</p>
	<p>
		I am currently a student enrolled at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago, 
		Illinois. I am studying Computer Science and minoring in Internet Application Development. 
		My hopes after graduating in Spring of 2019 are to attend the Institute of Design to 
		persue a Masters in Design. 
	</p>
	<p>
		I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona where I went to school at Vail Academy and High 
		School in the Vail School District. In high school I was heavily involved in my 
		<a href = "http://www.firstinspires.org/">FIRST</a> Robotics team; Team 1828 The BoxerBots. 
		My involvement in FIRST in high school is what inspired me to come to Illinois Tech and 
		persue a career in a STEM field. I am still heavily involved in FIRST today as a mentor 
		to team 5125, Hawks on the Horizon as well as a volunteer for 
		<a href = "http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> and 
		<a href = "http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FTC</a> events. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As far as my on campus involvement goes outside of taking classes, I currently have an 
		on campus job with the IPRO Department. I am also involved in one of the sororities on 
		my campus, Alpha Sigma Alpha (ASA). I rushed ASA in Spring of 2015 and have been an 
		active member ever since. This semester I picked up the position of Social Media and 
		Webmaster. So in total, I am now managing three different websites!

		<li><a href="asaiit.org">asaiit.org</a></li>
		<li>and this one you are currently on!</li>
	</ul>
	<br>
	<p>
		Outside of school, work and on campus extra cirricular activities, I like to spend my 
		free time doing a lot of odd ball things. I enjoy hula hooping as a form of exercise, 
		and yes, it can be a lot more complicated than simply moving the hoop around your hips. 
		I also have many crafting hobbies including: cross stitching, crocheting, knitting, 
		painting and wire wraping. 
	</p>
	<p>
		My biggest passion though is listening to EDM Music and attending music festivals and 
		raves. I began raving and going to festivals in the Summer of 2015 and fell in love 
		with the culture and the amazing people that I have been able to meet. Since beginning 
		my festival journey I have attended Spring Awakening, Mamby, Summer Set, Freaky Deaky, 
		EDC Las Vegas, North Coast and Basscenter. This summer I will be attending Spring 
		Awakening (for the third year in a row), Electric Forest, and Basscenter. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Below are the recap videos from my all time favorite festival experiences: Spring 
		Awakening 2015 and 2016, Summer Set 2015, and EDC 2016.
